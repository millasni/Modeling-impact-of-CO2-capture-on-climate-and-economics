# Modeling-impact-of-CO2-capture-on-climate-and-economics
This is my supervised project completed at HEC Montreal. 

The idea of the project was to augment an existing integrated assessment model (Ada-BaHaMa) with options of direct air capture (DAC) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) and explore their impact on climate change and economics.

All the details can be found in a pdf report:

* mathematical model formulation
* model calibration 
* augmenting the model with DAC and CCS 
* conducting a sensitivity analysis to changes in DAC and CCS cost
* exploring the interplay between DAC, CCS, adaptation and mitigation. 

The project was completed using GAMS optimization software.Â
